        <h1>Country profile</h1>
        <p>
            Canada is the second-largest country in the world by total area, stretching across the top of the North American continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and northwards into the Arctic region. The country is divided into ten provinces and 3 territories, and is governed under a federal system that shares some characteristics with its near-neighbour the USA, although the two countries are far more different than many people imagine.
